# marozzo-ui
React UI components used in marozzo.com.

This library is in **early alpha stage** and currently **not intended** for generic use.

# Reasoning
* Based on extensible, composable primitives (inspiration shamelessly taken from Rebass/Theme-UI and Chakra-UI)
* Written with, for and only in TypeScript
* Focus on app development, not static sites
* Component libraries are great up to the point where something you really need does not exist. I wanted to see whether it would be possible to make a library primarily for my own needs but then turning it to something that can easily be extended with totally new components that feel like they are part of the core, without havcing to mix and match libraries or throwing in new primitives.
* As much as I like Material-UI, Rebass, Chakra, UI Fabric and other design systems, I simply love creating my own more than using them. But they have greatly influenced the creation of this library.
