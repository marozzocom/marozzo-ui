# marozzo-ui

React UI components used in marozzo.com.

This library is still in **alpha stage**.

# Design principles

- Offer highly customizable clean primitives
- Create an opinionated set of UI components with a combination of the primitives
- Offer functionality as reusable hooks
- Keep component api simple -- instead make it easy to fork or rebuild new components (no custom renderers and overly complicated objects)
- Most of stylistic customization comes from theme and by exposing primitive style props to component
- Aim for good composition. While a _Card_ component may recommend a _CardHeading_, _CardBody_ and _CardActions_ as its content, allow passing in whatever as children instead of forcing to set these via props.

# Features

- Based on extensible, composable primitives (inspiration shamelessly taken from Rebass/Theme-UI and Chakra-UI)
- Written with, for and only in TypeScript
- Focus on app development, not static sites
- No support for legacy browsers such as IE11

# Installation

At this stage the package is only available from this GitHub registry: https://github.com/marozzocom/marozzo-ui/packages/71017

You will need to create a `.npmrc` file in the same folder as you `package.json` file with the following line
`@marozzocom:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`

Then you should be able to install the package with

`npm i @marozzocom/marozzo-ui`

You can then import everything you need with named imports, for example:

`import { Box, Text } from "@marozzocom/marozzo-ui`
